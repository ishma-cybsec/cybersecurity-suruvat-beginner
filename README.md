Python Security Tools – Fundamentals

This repository contains a set of small Python utilities developed to practice foundational cybersecurity concepts, including password hygiene, data confidentiality, and multi-factor authentication.

The tools are intentionally simple and terminal-based, focusing on clarity, correctness, and ethical use rather than advanced exploitation techniques.
